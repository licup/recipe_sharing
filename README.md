# recipe_sharing

## An old project from the Google CSSIx bootcamp. 

This app uses an API, a YAML file, and the jinja and webapps libraries in order to create an app that lets users input a recipe of their choosing. It then gets saved into a database that displays the recipes on a separate page. The recipes will be saved as long as the web template is running.
